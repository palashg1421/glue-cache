# Glue Cache
A light weight WordPress plugin for strong server side cache.

The functionality behind the plugin is to comress the html of the whole page and cached it. So the next time anyone tries to access the same page. It is served from cache.

No special setting and configuration required for it, simply activate it and use it. You can purge all the cache, any time from the admin bar.
