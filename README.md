# Glue Cache
A lightweight WordPress plugin that generates the server-side cache.
The functionality behind the plugin is to compress the HTML of the whole page and cached it.

The cache is so strong that it requires a purge even to see a small change like adding some text in the page, changing the menu, or changing the theme. You can purge all the cache any time from the admin bar.

It requires no setting and configuration. Just activates the plugin, and it is ready to use.
